# Programming in R : Week 1 - Notes

## Video 1: **Course Intro**

- 12 weeks course.

- R Programming is a buzz word and everyone from statisticians, researchers, data analyst and people associated with all kinds of predictive analysis, they find R to be really great.

- We will go over setting up environment, for working with R. Basic syntax, data types and we will go into details of R programming and end with predictive analysis.

- We will do data visualisation on csv, DB in charts and other graphical visualisation formats.

- Classification, regression, clustering and other statistical learning methods are also possible in R.

- Let's get started.

## Video 2: **History of R**

- We will go into the need of R, what makes it unique and what was used in past by statisticians and why R is better.

- R has become a buzz word, it's wildly popular.

- SPSS and SAS were used in past. However, R is open source unlike SPSS and SAS. Open source means it's licensed under GNU Public license and free to use.

- SPSS and SAS is proprietary and you can't use external plugins and source code is behind closed doors. This was major drawback of SPSS and SAS.

- On the other hand, anyone can download R and there is a team called R Development Core Team that maintains and oversees the development and vision of R based on real time requirements.

- What can we do with R? Analysis, statistical analysis and visualisation.

- R started initially as some tool in the market. R was developed by **Ross Ihaka** and **Robert Gentleman**, they developed R console to be used as for Maths, Big Data and analysis.

- Features of R:

  - Publically Licensed under GNU.
  - Comes in a pre-compiled binary version. Just download and run the file, without any installation hassles.
  - **Data Handling:** All features are available, no need to pay to unlock features as in SPSS and SAS.
  - Comes ready to use for data analysis and graphical facilities, more about these later on.

- Go to this [link](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/) and browse the directory as per your OS and under the base folder download the file.
- End goal is to setup R Console working on your system.

## Video 3: Using R Console - Getting started

- Command Prompt: If you start working with R Console, it is not possible to re-use code. To save statements in R you have to have a R script file.

- R Script: Type your code and run it in R script file just as you have option to run python code in IDLE as well as from a file.py.

- In R console you can directly enter the commands and get output immediately.

- R is case sensitive. Sample program:

- Go to file >> New Script to create a new R script and save it with a filename.R extension

- See `hello_world.R` to see sample program.

- In R we use # as **comment identifier** and won't execute with the code, only single line comments are allowed in R programming.

- A neat trick to run R without going to your console everytime, add folder `<R Install path>\R\bin\x64` to your path.

- Say you have Week-1 directory and inside it there is **hello_world.R** file, in that case now go to terminal type `Rscript hello_world.R` and you would get the output as shown here:
